coatingtk
=========

Python-package for simulation of dielectric mirror coatings.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy interface for coating
simulations, tailored to the needs of the gravitational wave community.
Especially, this means that this project is focussed on rather simple (design-
wise) single-wavelength coatings rather than e.g. dispersion-optimised
coatings. However, it aims to include coating thermal noise calculations.
